# Introduction

Thank you for choosing Parcelcraft. Our guiding philosophy has been to give our users the ability to create shipping labels in 1-click. 
Configuring the many defaults to enable 1-click shipments are optional, but you'll find the the extra work pays off, especially if you have a high shipping volume.
This guide has been written to help get you started quickly.  

> Parcelcraft is currently in private beta and is not available for installation in the Stripe App Marketplace yet.
