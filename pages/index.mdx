# Introduction

Thank you for choosing Parcelcraft. Our guiding philosophy has been to give our users the ability to create shipping labels in 1-click. To enable 1-click shipments in Parcelcraft will require more setup than other shipping apps, but we hope you agree the extra leg work pays off.  This guide has been written to get you started quickly.

> Parcelcraft is currently in private beta and is not available for installation in the Stripe App Marketplace yet.
