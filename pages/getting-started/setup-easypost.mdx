#### **How does the EasyPost Wallet work?**

The Wallet enables you to pay for EasyPost services such as labels for EasyPost Carrier Accounts, like USPS, and add-ons including insurance, carbon offsets, and more! Having a sufficiently funded Wallet is critical to prevent any hiccups in your shipping process from failed payments.

You can fund your EasyPost Wallet via ACH or Credit Card. After the initial deposit, you can set your Minimum Balance and recharge Amount. Your Wallet will automatically recharge with your set Amount once the balance drops below your Minimum Balance.

For example, let's say you have a Minimum Balance of $500 and a recharge Amount of $1,000. Once your Wallet's balance falls below $500, your Wallet will be recharged with $1,000.

#### **Is it better to pay via ACH or Credit Card?**

While the choice is yours: Credit cards are fast to set up, but they come with a 3.75% processing fee. Users who pay via ACH get to skip the fee and can rest assured that their shipping workflow will never be jammed by an expiration date, but will have to wait a few days for transfers.

**We recommend initially funding your account with a credit card to start shipping instantly, and then set up your ACH for long-term savings and stability.**
