# Automatically print label attachements sent to your email address

Parcelcraft can send label and form files to an email address.  You can do some additional setup to automatically print labels you recieve as attachements to your email address. Parcelcraft's philosophy is to enable 1-click shipping, with a proper setup, you shouldn't need to set your print options each time you ship.

> Note: Printing to email is not our recommendation, use the "Print to PrintNode" option for ease of setup instead.  PrintNode allows up to 50 free prints per month, and a reasonable fee for more quantity. PrintNode is the recommended option.

## Tools to automatically print email attachments

 There are several tools that can help you automatically print attachments that arrive in your to your email address:

- If you use Outlook, see [How to Print Incoming Mail Automatically in Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/automatically-print-incoming-mail-outlook-1173140).

- If you have an HP Printer, use [HPSmart](https://www.hpsmart.com/).  See [How do I ePrint?](Ihttps://www.hpsmart.com/us/en/cms/HPC/ePrint)
- Use Automatic Email Manager 6. See [Automatically print your emails with attachments](https://www.automatic-email-manager.com/feature-print-email-body-and-attachments).

Both labels and forms are sent to the same email address.  If you use one printer for labels and another printer for customs forms, you can create rules in your email client to forward to the correct email address based on the subject line of the email you receive from Parcelcraft.

After you set up your printer to receive email attachments, test printing both a label and form from the Parcelcraft printer settings page.

> Note: When you create return labels, you'll have the option to email labels directly to your customers, the settings here do not apply to customer return label emails.
