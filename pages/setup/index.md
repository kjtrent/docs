# Getting started

Thank you for choosing Parcelcraft.  While creating this app, our guiding philosophy has been to give our users the ability to create shipping labels in 1-click.  To enable 1-click shipping, quite a few default settings are required.  These default settings are optional and can be changed at any point when you're creating a label.  

## Tools

You'll need a few items to create shipping labels:

### Required tools

- A Stripe Account
- Printer & label media
- Scale

### Recommended tools for 1-click shipping

- A Digital Scale with a USB or serial port
- A 4x6 inch (102 x 152mm) **Thermal** label printer and labels
- A PrintNode Account
